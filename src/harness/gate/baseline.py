"""Baseline artifact I/O, generation, and fingerprint checking (spec §7, D3).

A baseline (``baselines/{candidate}.json``, committed) is the frozen
reference an ``eval gate`` run compares against: per-item, per-replicate,
per-field scores for the whole golden set, the raw model/judge outputs that
produced them, the spec §7 fingerprint (both as one opaque hash and as its
individual raw components, so a mismatch can be reported field-by-field), and
the measured adversarial-guardrail noise floor (D3's coarse guardrail must be
verified against real run-to-run variance *at baseline time*, not gate time).

**Fake-client/unit-test only (this ticket, T15):** real, traced, committed
baselines are generated in T16 after T12-T14 land (a real calibration
certificate and composite-mode decision must exist first). This module only
exposes ``generate_baseline`` as a library callable -- baselines are never
auto-created by the gate itself (spec §7's exit-2 contract: a missing
baseline fails the gate with a re-baseline instruction); CLI wiring
(``eval gate --update-baseline``) lands in T16.

**Raw-outputs storage: embedded, not a pointer.** The ticket allows either
"raw model and judge outputs" embedded directly, or "a pointer to their
committed location" -- provided the artifact stays self-sufficient for the
gate's paired-delta computation. Spec §7 explicitly settles this for this
codebase: ``baselines/`` is described as holding "per-field, per-replicate,
raw outputs" directly, and it is committed alongside ``results/published/``
as the *only* stored run data (the constitution's run-history cut means
``results/runs/`` -- where the intermediate ``run_eval`` scratch directory
this module drives lives -- is never committed and may be cleaned up at any
time). A pointer into that ephemeral directory would silently stop being
self-sufficient the moment it's cleaned up; embedding is the only choice that
keeps a committed ``baselines/{candidate}.json`` inspectable on its own
forever. Rows are stored as ``runner.RunRow`` verbatim (reused, not
duplicated) -- it already carries exactly this shape (per-field scores, raw
candidate output, raw per-field judge output, per-field judge rationales).

**Interface evolution beyond the ticket's literal block (documented here,
same convention as ``runner.py``'s module docstring for T08):**

- ``generate_baseline(config, model_key) -> BaselineFile`` is the ticket's
  literal signature. This module adds ``dataset`` (required, keyword-only --
  the golden set to score; mirrors ``run_eval``'s own explicit ``dataset``
  parameter rather than have this module duplicate the CLI's dataset-file
  loading), plus ``prompt``/``composite_mode``/``calibration_verdict``
  (keyword-only, defaulted) so a caller with a real certificate and
  composite-mode decision in hand (T16) can supply the real values while
  this ticket's fake-client tests can rely on sane, uncalibrated defaults --
  and ``runs_root``/``baselines_root`` (keyword-only, defaulted) purely for
  test isolation under ``tmp_path``, exactly as ``run_eval``'s own
  ``runs_root``/``max_workers`` were added beyond its ticket's literal
  signature.
- ``check_fingerprint(baseline, run) -> list[Mismatch]`` takes a
  ``FingerprintComponents`` as its ``run`` side, not a bare ``RunArtifact``.
  ``runner.py``'s own module docstring explains why: a ``RunArtifact``'s
  ``fingerprint`` is baked with *placeholder* ``composite_mode``/
  ``calibration_verdict`` (T08 has no certificate or composite-mode decision
  to draw on at run-persist time), so it cannot supply real values for
  either -- "T15/T16 ... should recompute their own comparison fingerprint
  from RunArtifact's raw components ... rather than trust this one for gate
  purposes." ``fingerprint_components_from_run`` is the supported way to do
  that recomputation once the real values are known (T16, from the
  certificate and composite-mode decision).
