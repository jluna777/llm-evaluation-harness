"""CI gate decision rule, sparse-delta warnings, adversarial guardrail, exit
codes (spec §7, D3, T16).

This module is the "decide" half of the gate; ``harness.reports.
render_gate_summary`` (T10) is the "render" half -- this module computes
every number ``GateSummaryData``/``CandidateGateResult`` carry and never
renders markdown itself (mirrors ``reports.py``'s purity contract: this
module is pure over already-loaded ``BaselineFile``/``RunArtifact``/
``Config``/``Certificate`` objects, no API calls, no filesystem access,
except ``update_baseline``/``update_baselines`` which are deliberately the
impure entry points, since generating a baseline necessarily drives real
candidate/judge calls).

**Two layers, deliberately separated (see tests/unit/gate/test_gate.py's
module docstring for the corresponding test split):**

1. Data extraction -- ``nominal_paired_deltas``, ``adversarial_composite_delta``,
   ``judge_error_rate`` -- turn a ``(BaselineFile, RunArtifact)`` pair into the
   raw numbers the decision rule needs.
2. Decision -- ``decide_candidate_result`` turns a list of per-item deltas (already
   extracted) into a ``CandidateGateResult`` via the stats modules
   (``sign_flip_test``, ``bca_ci``, ``mde``) and spec §7's fail condition.

``evaluate_gate`` composes both layers plus the fingerprint/judge-error-budget
checks into one pure orchestration function, returning a ``GateOutcome``
(0/1) or raising one of this module's own exceptions (2) -- see the module's
exit-code convention below.

**Item-level judge-error exclusion (binding precision point, spec §7 "missing
!= fail"):** unlike ``reports.py``'s ``_row_composite`` (which excludes only
the missing *field* from a row's own average, returning ``None`` only when
*every* mode-included field is missing), this module excludes the entire
*item* from the paired-delta computation the moment ANY mode-included field
is missing on ANY replicate, on EITHER side of the comparison (baseline or
run). This stricter convention is deliberate: a partial per-row average would
dilute a paired delta with an incomplete replicate; the ticket's contract is
that the whole item drops out, disclosed via an exclusion count, rather than
silently averaged over fewer samples than the other items got.

**Exit-code convention (this module's own design decision, since spec §7
enumerates measurement-error exit-2 conditions precisely but the CLI layer
also has setup-time errors spec doesn't classify -- revised, finding F1):**
exit 2 covers every condition that fires BEFORE a completed measurement
exists to render a verdict on: the spec-enumerated exceptions raised here
(``MissingBaselineError``, ``FingerprintMismatchError``,
``JudgeErrorBudgetExceededError``, ``NominalItemSetMismatchError`` -- finding
F4's fail-closed item-set check), ``runner.RunAborted`` (spec §7 explicitly
lists "aborted run" under measurement error for the *gate*, distinct from
``run``/``compare``'s own exit-1 treatment of the same exception), AND every
setup-time precondition failure that necessarily precedes any measurement --
``RunConfigMismatch``, ``MissingTracingError``, ``MissingCertificateError``,
``MissingApiKeyError``, ``ClientConstructionError`` (all previously
mismapped to exit 1 -- F1 corrected this: none of these can ever be "a
completed measurement whose verdict is fail", exit 1's OTHER meaning, so
lumping them in with that outcome was wrong from the start). All mapped at
the CLI layer (``cli.py``'s ``_gate_clean_exit``).

``GuardrailFloorError`` (raised only by ``--update-baseline``, never by the
decision-rule path) is the one deliberate exception to "setup failure -> exit
2": it fires only AFTER a real baseline candidate has been fully measured, so
it is exit 1 -- "a completed measurement whose verdict is fail" -- not a
measurement error.
