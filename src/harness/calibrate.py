"""Judge calibration: agreement report, certificate, self-consistency (spec
§5, §4; ticket T14).

**Candidate-outputs-for-calibration design (binding, read before touching
this module):** this module does NOT invent a parallel pipeline for
generating candidate outputs over the calibration emails. Instead it reuses
T08's ``run_eval``/``load_run`` machinery exactly the way ``eval run``/
``eval compare`` already do: the calibration procedure runs each candidate
over ``data/calibration/emails.jsonl`` via the ordinary ``run_eval`` path
(``cli.py``'s ``calibrate`` command drives this through the same
``_get_or_run`` seam ``run``/``compare`` use), producing one persisted
``RunArtifact`` per candidate. ``build_triples`` then *reconstructs* the
``(email, reference, candidate_value)`` triples this module needs straight
from that artifact's own persisted rows: ``email``/``expected`` come from the
artifact's embedded ``GoldenItem``s (persisted verbatim at run time, spec
AC5), and ``candidate_value`` comes from parsing that item's persisted
``raw_output`` JSON. No candidate call is ever made here -- only the JUDGE is
re-invoked (``judge_triples``, ``measure_self_consistency``), against
already-produced candidate output, which is exactly what "the judge is run
over the (email, reference, candidate_value) triples reconstructed from
persisted candidate outputs" means operationally.

Calibration runs are expected at K=1 (spec §5's 25 x 2 fields x 2 candidates
= 100 field judgments -- one candidate output per item per field, not K
replicates of it; ``CalibrationLabel`` itself carries no replicate index).
``build_triples`` tolerates K>1 defensively by always taking the
lowest-``replicate`` row per item, but production calibration runs should be
generated with ``k=1``.

Re-judging (rather than trusting the candidate run's own embedded
``field_scores``, which ``run_eval`` already computed via ``Judge.judge_field``
at run time) is deliberate: calibration must certify the CURRENT judge
(``judge_version()``), and re-invoking it here -- through the exact same
``Judge.judge_field`` call every production judged field goes through -- is
what lets this module assert its own ``judge_version()`` on the certificate
without trusting that the candidate run's manifest was produced under an
identical judge (a run and a calibration certification are not guaranteed to
happen atomically with each other).

**Statistics (spec §5, D2):** Cohen's kappa (``harness.stats.agreement.
cohens_kappa``) is the single agreement statistic, computed overall and per
candidate, always with a cluster-bootstrap CI resampling emails (judgments of
one email -- both candidates, both fields -- move together). Raw agreement
and label prevalence are carried through as descriptive context only, never
a decision input. Adequacy is decided on the OVERALL kappa point estimate
(``decide_verdict``); a per-candidate kappa gap above 0.2 is a flag for D1
review only (``per_candidate_divergence_flag``), never a gate condition.

**Self-consistency (spec §4):** 20 fixed ``(email, reference,
candidate-value)`` triples -- a deterministic prefix of the full,
sorted-by-``(item_id, candidate, field)`` triple set, so the same calibration
data always selects the same 20 -- are each judged 3x; the flip rate (the
fraction of the 20 for which the 3 judgments disagree) is reported and
carried into the certificate context.

**Test-retest ceiling (spec §5, ``--retest``):** intra-annotator kappa on the
label-id intersection of ``round="initial"`` and ``round="retest"`` labels,
with its own cluster-bootstrap CI, surfaced as ``ceiling_kappa`` on the
certificate and explicitly labeled *an estimate of the consistency ceiling*
in the rendered report -- a judge kappa exceeding it is estimation noise, not
a super-human judge (never treated as a red flag).

**Bootstrap omission disclosure (D2/agreement.py):** ``cohens_kappa``'s CI
path may emit exactly one ``RuntimeWarning`` disclosing how many degenerate
bootstrap resamples were omitted (see ``stats/agreement.py``'s module
docstring). Every kappa call in this module is wrapped to capture such
warnings via ``warnings.catch_warnings(record=True)`` rather than letting
them propagate to the caller's default warning handling, and the captured
messages are rendered verbatim in the calibration report's "Bootstrap
Disclosures" section -- silently swallowing them would hide exactly the
disclosure spec/D2 requires.

**Certificate (schema.py ``Certificate``, committed as
``data/calibration/certificate.json``):** ``build_certificate`` populates
every spec §5 field, including the additive ``per_candidate_kappa_ci`` (T14
closing a ledgered T01/T10 gap -- see ``schema.py``'s ``Certificate``
docstring). ``date`` defaults to the most recent ``label_date`` across all
labels (any round) unless an explicit override is supplied -- never
wall-clock-dependent, so tests and re-runs against the same label file always
produce the same certificate date.

**Label-to-output binding (finding F1):** a label only names a triple by
``(item_id, candidate, field)`` -- it says nothing about WHICH candidate
output was labeled. Since candidate runs are not guaranteed deterministic
(temp>0) and ``results/`` is gitignored (a run directory can be regenerated
at any time), that key alone can silently rebind a label to a DIFFERENT
candidate output than the one an owner actually looked at. Every
``CalibrationLabel`` therefore carries ``output_sha256`` -- the sha256 of the
exact ``candidate_value`` string labeled (``hash_output``) -- and
``pair_with_labels``/``pair_judgments_with_labels`` verify it against the
live/persisted candidate output before any pairing happens, all-or-nothing
(``CalibrationBindingError`` on any mismatch, naming every offending key --
never a silent partial exclusion, which would hide exactly the kind of
corruption this check exists to catch).

**Zero-API recomputability (finding F2):** a live run persists every judge
call it makes -- one row per judged triple plus every self-consistency
repeat -- to ``data/calibration/judgments.jsonl`` (``write_judgments_jsonl``,
written atomically: temp file + ``os.replace``, mirroring ``runner.py``'s
``_repair_truncated_tail`` precedent). ``run_calibration_offline`` then
recomputes the FULL report + certificate from that file plus ``labels.jsonl``
with ZERO ``Judge``/``ModelClient`` construction -- spec AC5's zero-API
recompute, extended from ``eval rescore`` (which recomputes a run's score
from persisted candidate output) to calibration (recomputing the agreement
statistics from persisted judge output). It fails loudly rather than
recompute against a certificate the data no longer supports: a
``judge_version`` mismatch against the CURRENT judge (``StaleJudgmentsError``
-- stale judgments must not certify today's judge) or an ``output_sha256``
mismatch against a label (``CalibrationBindingError``, the same F1 check,
against the persisted hash rather than a freshly recomputed one since no
candidate output is available offline to re-hash).
