"""Per-email composite score (spec §6).

Both modes share one definition -- unweighted mean of the included fields'
0/1 scores, scaled to 0-100 -- and differ only in which fields are included:
``FULL_7`` averages all seven scored fields; ``DETERMINISTIC_5`` excludes the
two judge-scored fields for judge-excluded reporting (e.g. an inadequate
calibration verdict). The composite definition is part of the run
fingerprint (``config.fingerprint``'s ``composite_mode`` argument) and its
mode names are consumed verbatim by the CI gate (T15/T16) -- do not rename.
