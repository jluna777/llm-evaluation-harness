"""Sign-flip permutation test (spec §7).

Tests whether a set of paired per-item deltas (``current - baseline``) is
extreme under the null hypothesis that each delta's sign is equally likely
to be positive or negative -- i.e. that there is no true, sign-consistent
effect. The one-sided variant tests the *regression* direction (deltas more
negative than chance would produce) and backs the CI gate; the two-sided
variant tests either direction and serves ``eval compare``.

Zero-valued deltas carry no sign to flip -- multiplying a zero by +/-1 is a
no-op -- so they are excluded from the ``2**m`` enumeration/resampling space.
They are not dropped from the statistic itself, though: the test statistic
is the mean over *all* deltas (zeros included, diluting the mean toward
zero), while only the ``m_nonzero`` nonzero deltas have their sign flipped
to build the null distribution.

Exact mode enumerates all ``2**m_nonzero`` sign assignments when
``m_nonzero <= 20`` (a hair over one million, cheap with vectorized numpy).
Above that, a seeded Monte Carlo draw of ``n_resamples`` random sign
assignments estimates the same quantity, using the standard
``p = (b + 1) / (B + 1)`` bias-corrected estimator (never zero, matching
``scipy.stats.permutation_test``'s approximate mode).

    ``m_nonzero`` and ``min_attainable_p`` are load-bearing for the CI
    gate's sparse-delta disclosure (T16): they let callers warn when too few
    nonzero deltas exist for rejection to be possible at a given alpha.

    For two-sided tests, the ``min_attainable_p`` floor reflects a mirror-pairing
    constraint: because two-sided extremeness (|stat| >= |observed|) is invariant
    under full sign-negation of all deltas, extreme configurations always come in
    equal-magnitude pairs (positive and negative). This reduces the count of
    distinct attainable p-values; the floor is 2**(1-m) for m >= 1.
