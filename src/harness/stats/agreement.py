"""Cohen's kappa with cluster-bootstrap CI (judge-human agreement, spec §5, D2).

Cohen's kappa is the single statistic that decides judge-calibration
adequacy (constitution §5 conformance: one agreement method, not several --
Gwet's AC1 was considered and dropped, D2 amendment 2026-07-04a). Raw
agreement and label prevalence are reported alongside it as descriptive
context only; spec §5 is explicit that they never decide anything.

Labels are the harness's binary pass/fail verdict strings (schema.py's
``CalibrationLabel.verdict``). By calling convention ``a`` is the reference
(owner/human) label sequence and ``b`` is the judge's verdicts -- this
mirrors the eventual ``eval calibrate`` call, ``cohens_kappa(owner_labels,
judge_labels)``. ``prevalence`` reports the fraction of the positive class
("pass") within ``a`` specifically (documented here since the interface
takes two symmetric-looking sequences): curated calibration sets skew toward
"pass" (D2), the regime where kappa is most needed because raw agreement
alone is misleading. ``raw_agreement`` is the fraction of paired positions
where the two sequences agree exactly (observed agreement, ``p_o``).

All calibration CIs are cluster-bootstrap resampling emails (D2 amendment
2026-07-04a): judgments within one email are correlated (fields and
candidates within an email share context), so naive per-observation
resampling understates uncertainty. This module builds the CI by delegating
to :func:`harness.stats.bootstrap.bca_ci` over an array of *index positions*
rather than the labels themselves: ``bca_ci`` only knows how to resample and
reduce a plain 1-D array, so the "statistic" passed to it is a closure that
looks up ``a``/``b`` at the resampled positions and recomputes kappa on that
subset. Passing ``clusters`` straight through makes ``bca_ci`` resample whole
clusters of index positions together -- exactly "resample clusters of index
positions, recompute kappa."

Degenerate single-category convention: standard Cohen's kappa is undefined
(0/0) whenever both label sequences collapse onto one shared category --
chance agreement ``p_e`` hits 1, so ``(p_o - p_e) / (1 - p_e)`` divides by
zero. This mirrors ``sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score``'s own default
(``replace_undefined_by=nan``): the chosen convention here is to return
``float("nan")`` for ``kappa`` rather than raising, so a degenerate
calibration slice (or an unlucky bootstrap resample that happens to draw an
all-one-category subsample) flows through reporting code instead of
crashing. Callers that need to react to an undefined kappa check
``math.isnan(result.kappa)``.

That same convention means individual *bootstrap replicates* of kappa can
come back NaN even when the full sample's point estimate is well-defined:
an unlucky cluster resample can land entirely on agreeing single-category
clusters, which is near-certain to happen at least once across thousands of
resamples on a well-agreeing, pass-skewed calibration set. This module
therefore calls :func:`bca_ci` with ``nan_policy="omit"``: the CI is
computed over the non-degenerate replicates, conditioning it on
non-degenerate resamples (a small, accepted bias), and the count of omitted
replicates is disclosed via a ``RuntimeWarning`` rather than silently
propagating into a ``(nan, nan)`` interval.
