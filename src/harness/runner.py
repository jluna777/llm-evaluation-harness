"""Run loop: items x replicates x candidates, persisted incrementally, resumable (spec §6, §9).

``run_eval`` drives one candidate over a dataset for ``k`` replicates each,
writing one JSONL row per completed ``(item, replicate)`` pair as soon as it
finishes -- never buffered until the end -- so an interrupted run can be
resumed by calling ``run_eval`` again with the *same* arguments: the run
directory is derived deterministically from the call's own inputs (model key,
dataset content, k, prompt version, dataset version), so an identical
invocation always maps back to the same directory and never re-invokes a
client for an ``(item, replicate)`` that already has a persisted row (spec
§9's "a returned response is never re-sampled", extended across runs).

**Design decisions beyond the ticket's literal interfaces (documented here
because nothing upstream pins them):**

- ``ModelKey`` bundles the candidate label ("a"/"b") with the two concrete
  ``ModelClient`` implementations a run needs (candidate + judge). The
  ticket's signature is ``run_eval(config, model_key, *, k, dataset,
  prompt)`` with no separate client parameter, and this module must not
  import provider SDKs (that stays in ``models/*_client.py`` and the T11
  CLI, which constructs real clients "only when a live run is required").
  Bundling both clients into the object passed as ``model_key`` is the
  smallest way to satisfy both constraints; tests construct ``ModelKey``
  directly with fakes, no SDK or transport mocking needed.
- ``runs_root`` and ``max_workers`` are additional *keyword-only, defaulted*
  parameters appended after the ticket's documented ones. They don't change
  the call shape for any caller that only uses the documented arguments;
  they exist so tests can redirect output under ``tmp_path`` and control
  concurrency for deterministic ordering, without the run loop reaching into
  test-only global state.
- Bounded concurrency uses a fixed ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` of 4 workers by
  default. All three SDK clients are synchronous, and a candidate/judge call
  is network-latency-bound, not CPU-bound, so a small thread pool buys most
  of the achievable overlap without hammering per-minute provider rate
  limits harder than necessary -- 4 is a deliberately conservative, fixed
  bound (not tuned per-provider). All tasks for a run are submitted to the
  pool upfront, so a worker that finishes a task can otherwise race straight
  to the next queued one before the main thread ever inspects the failed
  future -- a shared ``threading.Event`` set the instant any task raises
  *any* exception (not just ``TransportExhausted`` -- C2), and checked at
  the top of every task, is what actually stops that extra, unnecessary
  spend once a failure is known (a task already in flight on another worker
  when the event is set still runs to completion; only not-yet-started
  tasks are skipped). ``run_eval``'s gather loop mirrors this: any worker
  exception -- transport or otherwise -- triggers
  ``executor.shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=True)`` from a ``finally``
  block before ``RunAborted`` is raised, so the pool is never left running
  (and spending) after control returns to the caller.
- **Missing-judge-verdict representation (binding for T10/T11/T15/T16):** a
  judge error (``JudgeResult.verdict is None``) is recorded as an explicit
  ``None`` in that row's ``field_scores[field]`` -- never a dropped key,
  never coerced to ``0``. This is unambiguous because the *other* path that
  scores a field ``0`` (candidate output that is schema-invalid or a
  refusal) always scores *all seven* fields ``0`` at once and never leaves
  any of them ``None`` -- so a lone ``None`` can only mean "judged, but the
  judge call errored". ``raw_judge``/``judge_rationales`` are ``None`` for a
  field precisely when no judge call was made at all for it (the candidate
  output failed schema validation, so there was nothing to judge); when a
  judge call *was* made but errored, ``raw_judge`` still carries the judge's
  raw response text (``JudgeResult.raw`` is always populated) while
  ``judge_rationales`` is ``None`` (no rationale on error).
- Per-row ``usage``/``served_model_version`` describe the *candidate* call
  only; that pair is part of the binding row schema and stays candidate-only
  on purpose. Judge-call accounting is additive rather than folded into
  those two fields: ``RunRow.judge_usage`` is a dict keyed by judged-field
  name holding that field's judge-call token usage (``None`` for a field
  that was never judged, e.g. a candidate schema-invalid/refusal failure --
  mirroring ``raw_judge``/``judge_rationales``'s existing None-means-no-call
  convention). ``RunArtifact.judge_usage_totals()`` sums it across every row,
  kept separate from ``usage_totals()`` (candidate-only, unchanged) so T16's
  cost totals can report both distinctly rather than conflating a 2:1
  call-volume-different pair of costs into one number. The run's judge
  identity was already covered statically by ``judge_version()`` (a hash
  baking in the pinned judge model id string); ``served_versions["judge"]``
  (aggregated from each judged field's ``JudgeResult.served_model_version``,
  last-call-wins, same convention as the candidate's entry) adds the runtime
  alias-drift *observation* that static hash can't provide on its own.
- Run identity (the run directory name, via ``_run_id``, and
  ``_check_manifest_compatible``'s resume guard) folds in the *requested*
  candidate and judge model ids from ``config.models`` -- not just the
  abstract "a"/"b" label. Keying identity on the label alone would let a
  provider-side or config-side model swap (same label, different served
  model) silently resume into a stale run's rows: same directory, same
  manifest, zero new calls, ``completed=True``, for what is actually a
  different model. Folding the requested model ids into the hash means a
  swap lands in a *new* run directory automatically; folding them into the
  compatibility check as well catches the residual case of a hash
  collision or a hand-edited manifest pointing at a directory that was
  never regenerated.
- The manifest stores a fingerprint computed with placeholder
  ``composite_mode=FULL_7`` and ``calibration_verdict="uncalibrated"``,
  because T08 has no certificate (T14 doesn't exist yet) and no report-time
  composite-mode decision to draw on. This fingerprint's purpose here is
  run-identity (resume matching, "did the prompt version change") rather
  than the gate's baseline-comparison fingerprint -- T15/T16 have the real
  calibration verdict and composite mode in hand and should recompute their
  own comparison fingerprint from ``RunArtifact``'s raw components
  (``served_versions``, ``judge_version``, ``prompt_version``,
  ``dataset_version``) rather than trust this one for gate purposes.
